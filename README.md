microC-OSII Rate-Monotonic(RM) schedule algorithm
=

Objective:   
To implement the Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduler for periodic tasks and observe the scheduling behaviors.

Problem Definition:  
Implement the following three task sets of periodic tasks. Add necessary code to the μC/OS-II scheduler in the kernel level to observe how the task suffers from the scheduler. We give the files for the parameter of the task. 

Periodic Task Set = {τID (ID, arrival time, execution time, period)}   
Example Task Set 1 = {τ1 (1, 0, 1, 3), τ2 (2, 0, 3, 5)}   



Example Task Set 2 = {τ1 (1, 0, 1, 3), τ2 (2, 1, 1, 4), τ3 (3, 2, 1, 5) }   
Example Task Set 3 = {τ1 (1, 0, 3, 8), τ2 (2, 1, 2, 6), τ3 (3, 0, 4, 15)}
